        b WaitArg
        The input containing callbacks to handle the change of the browser state.
        | The 'change of browser state' is also descibed here. Some points about the WaitArg
        p Wookie.waitForLocation creates NavigationRecord
        p NavigationRecord - a record stored in an array. Contains WaitArg and a promise to NavigationDoneEvent  (may contain eventId??)
        p PageDoneEvent - when browser finishes loading a page (ok, timeout, nok).
        p NavigationMatcher
        p WookieView.scanNavRecords - a method to scan records to find matching page-done handlers & check timeouts
        p WookieView.includeStuffOnPage â€“ a method which includes jQuery and other scripts once the page is done (including timeout situation).
        p WookieView.registerScanningTimer - runs a timer to scan records for timeouts.
        li
            ul
        b
    h2 Important notes
        p If the page is not yet ready, clicking a button (JS interacton in code) won't work.
        p (todo?) As there is only one page being loaded at the moment of time, it makes sense to maintain a single NavigationRecord in the wookie.navigationRecords
